## Overview

Quarters was made as a solution to the common question asked by millions of gamers "Why can’t you use your coins from one game in another?" Quarters is a Game-agnostic Digital Currency that allows your gaming users to do just that. Quarters also does not limit developers to any particular platform or group of games but are free to integrate their own games into the Quarters ecosystem.

You can learn about Quarters in many ways. You can see Quarters work yourself by creating an account with the [Quarters Platform](https://www.poq.gg/) and participating to win your very own Quarters, which you can then use to play games. You can learn more about the financial incentives behind Quarters on our [Investors Site](https://invest.poq.gg/). See how Quarters works with Creators on our [Creators Site](https://create.poq.gg/).

To learn about the Quarters Cryptocurrency itself, you can reference the [Quarters Whitepaper](https://invest.poq.gg/POQ_Whitepaper_v4.0.pdf)

Quarters are tokens following the [ERC20 standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/),
hosted on the [Klaytn blockchain](https://www.klaytn.com/), and managed by
