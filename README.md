## Overview

Game currencies are typically trapped within games, and when a player chooses to
move to another game they can't take their hard-earned in-game currency with
them. Quarters were created to solve this problem. With Quarters, players have
the freedom to move across games and across platforms seamlessly without losing
their in-game currency. Quarters are an interoperable, safe, and fun in-game
utility token that empowers players and developers with the choice and
flexibility to choose.

## Developers

Monetize and grow your game with Quarters! Create your own economies, share
tokens across games and platform, remove paywalls, and trigger in-game
transactions in real time. By integrating Quarters your game will become part of
the Quarters ecosystem and community of players with Quarters already in their
wallets, expanding your player audience. Quarters are an Ethereum [ERC-20
standard
token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/), hosted
on the [Polygon blockchain](https://polygon.technology/), and managed by [POQ's
main smart
contract](https://github.com/weiks/quarters-sol/blob/main/contracts/Quarters.sol).
