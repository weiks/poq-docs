## Overview

Game currencies are typically trapped within games and if a player chooses to move to another game their hard-earned in-game currency will remain in the old game. Quarters were created to solve this problem. With Quarters, players have the freedom to move across games and across platforms seamlessly without losing their hard-earned in-game currency. Quarters are an interoperable, safe, and fun in-game utility token that empowers players and developers with the choice and flexibility to choose.

## Developers

Monetize and grow your game with Quarters. Create your own economies, share tokens cross-game and cross-platform, remove paywalls, and trigger in-game transactions in real time. By integrating Quarters your game will become part of the Quarters ecosystem and community of players with Quarters already in their wallets, expanding your player audience. Quarters are an Ethereum ERC-20 standard token, hosted on the Klaytn blockchain, and managed by POQ's main smart contract.
